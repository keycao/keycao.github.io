    <h1>The Keycao Mission</h1>
    <p>Making quality artisan keycaps require large amounts of time and skill to create. This means that they can sometimes become so rare and sought after that many in the community will never get a chance to see them for themselves.</p>
    <p>It is my mission to combat this by spreading the joy of artisan keycaps one chocolate at a time!</p>

    <h1>The Chocolate</h1>
    <p>We use high quality chocolate that is carefully tempered to give our chocolates a beautiful shine, a satifying snap, and a shelf life long enough for you to enjoy the sculpt before you enjoy the chocolate.</p>
    <p>Our current chocolates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dark - 72%</li>
      <li>Very Dark - 80%</li>
